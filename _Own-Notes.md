# Tasks

- Customer details model, were id, name, order history, points, etc. can be stored.

- Lets do a backend clean up, etc. Plus maybe it's time do a massive code cleanup, in all project.. I'm sure it is more "left over". We just have to be careful, so we don't remove anything needed, etc.

## Already done [x] And [ ] is to look at some more

[ ] - I still having the same issue on my iPhone 17 Pro Max, and other iPhones, were I still get the same behavior, But on Android Phones emulators on Android studio, it works fine.... 

[X] Start by reading this part "🔴 Session: 2026-02-28 11:33" of the @DEVLOG.md file, so you know were we left of...
[X] First time I login to to site (frontend) the top-bar is in the "safe-area" so "hamburger menu" icon cant be clicked, etc.
But the funny part is if I close the app and reopen it, (app opens strait to the dashboard, not thru the login-form) it starts with top-bar in the right place (and its working as it should by sticking to the top, etc.)
But when I open sidebar it's in safe-area.
Here is screenshots, so you can see for your self: @screenshot-1.jpeg @screenshot-2.jpeg

- Delete the AI assistant component. we will add that again at a later time. So everything regarding that should be deleted.
- Delete "System Status" and "Recent Logs" cards on dashboard start page
- Splash-screen duration is to short
- Change "Restaurant 1" and "Restaurant 2" -> "Kalianak Depot 1" and "Kalianak Depot 2"
- Hide the AI Assistant floating action button in lower right corner. (we will develop all that at a later point, etc.)
- Change the text on login-form page "Enterprise management system. Integrated with Django backend for seamless operations" to "Sistem POS untuk restoran Ikan Bakar Kalianak" and row under "by Kalianak Tech"
