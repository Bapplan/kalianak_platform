# Issues & edits to project

I need you to make a new "part" of the platform that goes in the member_app.
First make sure to make a GIT sub repo. and add to the platform (.gitmodules), like the other sub repos
The full develop plan and description is in @member_app.md.
Because it is a big and important side project, I need you to make your own step by step develop plan, that fits you and were you can mark the steps done, after you finish them, etc.
Also update all files necessary to make `member_app` part of the platform, for example: @README.md, @GEMINI.md, etc.

I successfully ran the makemigrations and migrate users, etc. and before we continue, you should navigate http://localhost:5173/menu and http://localhost:5173/history and http://localhost:5173/profile and check the console... and check backend logs (docker)

yes continue with Phase 5
