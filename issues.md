# Issues & edits to project

- On `Bank & Cash Flow` page in `Ledger History` the Category column is not really responsive, etc. The category's: Food Sales, QRIS Clearing, etc. is "outside" the Badge, on smaller screens. Maybe make font smaller on small screen, etc.
- On `Financial Insights` page we need a dropdown element with all the Dishes from the menu, and when a Dish selected, the sales (orders) statistics is shown. One card for Total sum for all the Dishes orders, one card for total sum of each Dish item (Ingredients in Dish).
- I hope the "... card for total sum of each Dish item, etc." is possible to make... otherwise tell me if its a way of modify the setup to make that possible, etc.

- Could you list the items in the "Select a Dish..." dropdown in Sub categories (first "Menu Utama" then "Lainnya" then "Snacks" and last Minuman) and each categories in alfabetical order.

- Can you populate (were it's missing some ingredients in the Dish, etc.): Every Dish that begins with "Ikan Bakar Gurami" and "Paket Kotak Ikan Gurami Bakar" needs to have under "Bahan dalam Menu (Ingredients in Dish)" the same items in "Ingredient" and same value as "Amount" and "Unit", etc. as the Dish "Ikan Bakar Gurami (Badan + Nasi)"
