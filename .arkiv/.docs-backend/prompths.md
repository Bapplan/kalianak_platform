Read SETUP.md file to understand the project

Remove all View Transitions effects, etc. 

- I still see "view-transitions effects", or if not "view-transitions", it is some other blinking effects on the cards on landing page.
- On pages that have a "Kembali (Back)" Button you can delete (or hide) the the Title text "Kalianak POS" (or if easier, make the Button and text more responsive on mobile screens)
- On "Pesanan Saat Ini (Current Order)" its now only "MENU DALAM PESANAN" and "MINUMAN DALAM PESANAN" as category's, we need to change so Current Order list have the Category's from the Model "Kategori (Categories)"
